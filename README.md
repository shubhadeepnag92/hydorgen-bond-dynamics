# hydorgen-bond-dynamics
In this Fortran Program, average number of hydrogen bond, the continuous and the intermittent HB correlation functions are calculated
The correlation functions are calculated from the definitions given in Amalendu Chandra, Phys. Rev. Lett. 85, 768 â€“ Published 24 July 2000
https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.85.768

The fortran program is hbond_num_acf.f95 
A sample trajectory file "npt_500fs.xyz" is given here along with the details of input variables given in "input_HB.dat"

The number of avg. hydrogen is written in "hbnum.dat"
The coorelation functions are written in "hbac.dat" file
